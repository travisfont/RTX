Sky is a **decentralized reserve currency protocol** inspired by OlympusDAO (OHM), offering a stablecoin-like asset backed by a treasury of diversified crypto assets.  
 
As of the latest available information:  
- **SKY does not currently include Real-World Assets (RWAs)** in its treasury.  
- Its reserves consist primarily of **crypto-native assets** (e.g., stablecoins, ETH, or LP tokens) rather than tokenized traditional assets like bonds or real estate.  

### **Key Details About SKY.money:**  
1. **Model**: Similar to **OlympusDAO**, it uses a **bonding/staking mechanism** to manage supply and stabilize value.  
2. **Backing**: Treasury holds **volatile and stable crypto assets** (not RWAs).  
3. **Goal**: Provide a decentralized, algorithmic alternative to stablecoins.  

### **Could RWAs Be Added Later?**  
- Some OHM forks (e.g., KLIMA) have explored RWAs (e.g., carbon credits).  
- If SKY.money expands into RWAs, it would likely announce it via:  
  - Official docs ([docs.sky.money](https://docs.sky.money))  
  - Governance votes (if decentralized)  

## July of 2025: Treasury Holdings

Here’s a deeper analysis of **SKY.money’s treasury holdings** and whether it could integrate RWAs in the future:

---

### **1. Current Treasury Composition (Crypto-Native)**
Based on its OlympusDAO-inspired model, SKY’s treasury likely holds:
- **Stablecoins** (e.g., USDC, DAI) for liquidity.
- **Volatile crypto assets** (e.g., ETH, WBTC) for yield.
- **LP tokens** from decentralized exchanges (e.g., SKY/ETH pools).
- **Protocol-owned liquidity (POL)** to reduce reliance on external market makers.

**Why no RWAs yet?**  
Projects like SKY typically prioritize crypto collateral first for:  
- **Composability** (easy integration with DeFi).  
- **Transparency** (on-chain verification).  
- **Speed** (avoiding regulatory/off-chain delays).  

---

### **2. How to Verify SKY’s Treasury**
To check its exact holdings:  
1. **Treasury Dashboard**: Look for a "Transparency" or "Backing" tab on [sky.money](https://sky.money).  
2. **Etherscan**: Search the treasury wallet address (often listed in docs).  
3. **DeFi Llama**: Check if it’s tracked as a protocol ([defillama.com](https://defillama.com)).  

*Example*: OlympusDAO’s treasury is visible at [olympusdao.eth.link](https://olympusdao.eth.link).

### **3. Potential for Future RWA Integration**
**Signs SKY might add RWAs:**  
- **Demand for stability**: If crypto volatility hurts SKY’s peg, RWAs like Treasuries could help.  
- **Governance proposals**: Token holders may vote to diversify into bonds/real estate.  
- **Partner announcements**: Collaborations with RWA platforms (e.g., Ondo, Matrixdock).  

**Challenges:**  
- **Regulatory hurdles**: Tokenizing RWAs requires legal compliance.  
- **Liquidity**: RWAs are harder to liquidate quickly than crypto.

### **4. Alternatives If You Want RWAs Now**  
If SKY lacks RWAs, consider:  
| Protocol | RWA Focus | Token |  
|----------|-----------|-------|  
| **MakerDAO** | U.S. Treasuries | MKR |  
| **Ondo Finance** | Tokenized bonds | ONDO |  
| **Clearpool** | Corporate credit | CPOOL |  
| **RealT** | Tokenized real estate | REALT |  

---

### **5. Actionable Next Steps**  
1. **Join SKY’s Discord/Telegram** and ask the team directly about RWA plans.  
2. **Monitor governance votes** (e.g., Snapshot) for treasury-related proposals.  
3. **Compare APYs**: RWAs often offer lower but steadier yields than crypto.
