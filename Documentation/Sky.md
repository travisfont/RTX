# Sky (SKY)

Sky is a **decentralized reserve currency protocol** inspired by OlympusDAO (OHM), offering a stablecoin-like asset backed by a treasury of diversified crypto assets.  
 
As of the latest available information:  
- **SKY does not currently include Real-World Assets (RWAs)** in its treasury.  
- Its reserves consist primarily of **crypto-native assets** (e.g., stablecoins, ETH, or LP tokens) rather than tokenized traditional assets like bonds or real estate.  

### **Key Details About SKY.money:**  
1. **Model**: Similar to **OlympusDAO**, it uses a **bonding/staking mechanism** to manage supply and stabilize value.  
2. **Backing**: Treasury holds **volatile and stable crypto assets** (not RWAs).  
3. **Goal**: Provide a decentralized, algorithmic alternative to stablecoins.  

### **Could RWAs Be Added Later?**  
- Some OHM forks (e.g., KLIMA) have explored RWAs (e.g., carbon credits).  
- If SKY.money expands into RWAs, it would likely announce it via:  
  - Official docs ([docs.sky.money](https://docs.sky.money))  
  - Governance votes (if decentralized)
