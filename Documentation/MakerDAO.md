# MakerDAO (MKR)

**MakerDAO** holds a significant amount of **Real-World Assets (RWAs)** as collateral to back its stablecoin, **DAI**. RWAs have become a major part of MakerDAO's treasury strategy, providing yield and stability.  

### **Key Facts About MakerDAO’s RWA Holdings**  
1. **Primary RWA Collateral: U.S. Treasury Bonds**  
   - MakerDAO allocates billions of dollars into **short-term U.S. Treasuries** through partners like:  
     - **Monetalis (MIP65)**  
     - **BlockTower**  
     - **Coinbase Custody (for institutional-grade management)**  
   - These bonds generate **low-risk yield (~4-5% APY)**, which helps stabilize DAI.  

2. **Private Credit & Loans**  
   - MakerDAO funds **real-world loans**, including:  
     - **Mortgages** (via New Silver)  
     - **Small-business lending** (via 6s Capital)  
     - **Bank loans** (via Huntingdon Valley Bank)  

3. **RWA Dominance in DAI Backing**  
   - As of mid-2024, **over 50% of DAI’s collateral** comes from RWAs (mostly Treasuries).  
   - The rest is backed by crypto (ETH, WBTC) and stablecoins (USDC).  

### **Why Does MakerDAO Use RWAs?**  
- **Stability**: Treasuries are less volatile than crypto.  
- **Yield**: Earns passive income to fund protocol operations.  
- **Scalability**: Allows DAI to grow beyond purely crypto-backed models.  

### **Impact on MKR Token**  
- **Revenue from RWAs** is used to buy back and burn MKR (reducing supply).  
- **MKR holders govern RWA decisions**, voting on new collateral types.
